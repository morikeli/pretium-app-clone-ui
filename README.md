## Overview
The Petrium Clone App is a streamlined mobile application developed with Flutter, replicating the core user authentication flow found in the original Petrium app. It offers a clean and responsive UI, following modern design principles and ensuring a smooth user experience.  

### Core features
1. Onboarding Screens
    - Three-step onboarding experience introducing the app's purpose.
    - Implemented with the smooth_page_indicator package for elegant page indicators.
    - DRY and maintainable layout using controller-driven logic and reusable UI components.

2. User Authentication
    - **Login Screen**
    
      Secure and responsive form with validation and password visibility toggle.

    - **Signup Screen**
      
      Includes input validation, custom password fields, and terms & conditions acceptance logic with toast notifications (via toastification).

3. Password Management
    - **Forgot Password**
      
      Users can request a reset code with proper email validation and modal dialog confirmation.

    - **OTP Verification**
      
      Dedicated screen for entering the OTP code sent to the userâ€™s email.

    - Reset Password
    
      Allows users to securely enter and confirm a new password. Includes validation to ensure password match.

### Tech Stack
- Framework: Flutter
- State Management: StatefulWidget (can be upgraded to Provider, GetX, etc.)
- Notifications: toastification for in-app toasts
- Form Validation: Custom validators and built-in Form widgets
- Reusable Components: DRY codebase with shared CustomTextField, validators, dialogs

### Status

This is a frontend-only clone focusing on the user interface and flow. Backend integration, persistent auth, and user data management can be added to make it fully functional.
